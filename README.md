Blind Image Deconvolution using Deep Generative Priors:
This research proposes an innovative approach to tackle the challenging task of blind image deconvolution (also known as blind deblurring). The goal is to recover a sharp image and the blur kernel from a blurry and potentially noisy observation.

The method leverages deep generative networks. Specifically, two separate generative models are employed:

One model is trained to produce sharp images.
The other model is trained to generate blur kernels from lower-dimensional parameters.
The deblurring process operates in the latent space of these pretrained generative models, using an alternating gradient descent scheme.
The approach shows promising results even for heavily blurred and noisy images.
Interestingly, it demonstrates that including a generative prior can be beneficial, especially for richer image datasets.
Unlike conventional end-to-end approaches, which ignore the underlying convolution operator during training, this method explicitly incorporates generative priors1.

Depth-Color Correlation-Guided Dark Channel Prior for Underwater Images:
In this work, the concept of depth-color correlation is introduced based on the dark channel prior (DCP).
Additionally, a multi-scale dehazing and denoising module is embedded to effectively handle hazy content and noise interference in underwater images2.

Improved Blind Deconvolution with Dark Channels:
This technique enhances blind deconvolution by predicting the blur kernel based on dark channels before achieving clear image recovery.
By leveraging dark channels, it aims to improve the restoration of blurred images3.

Single Image Enhancement Technique Using Dark Channel Prior:
This method combines edge detection, sequential decomposition, and the optimized dark channel prior for image enhancement.
It separates sky and non-sky areas, enhancing the former while applying the dark channel prior to the latter4.

Blind Image Deconvolution Using Variational Deep Image Prior:

Another approach involves a variational deep image prior (VDIP) for blind image deconvolution.
VDIP exploits hand-crafted image priors on latent sharp images and approximates a distribution for each pixel, leading to better-constrained optimization5.
These techniques showcase the exciting intersection of image processing, machine learning, and prior-based approaches. Whether it’s recovering sharp images from blurry ones or enhancing underwater scenes, researchers continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in image restoration and enhancement.
